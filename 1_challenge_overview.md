# Challenge Overview – Crypto Oracle Fortune Prototype

## 🎯 Goal

Build an interactive web application that connects to users’ crypto wallets, retrieves token balances, and uses AI to generate personalized “fortunes” inspired by BaZi (Chinese Four Pillars of Destiny).  
Users can then chat with the AI about their crypto future.

---

## 🧱 Key Features

- Connect a crypto wallet (MetaMask / WalletConnect / RainbowKit)
- Read token balances from at least **two EVM-compatible chains** (ZetaChain + one or more: Ethereum, Optimism, Base)
- Display user’s **top tokens**
- Generate personalized “crypto fortunes” using an **LLM API**
- Allow **interactive chat** with the AI based on the user’s wallet contents

---

## 📦 Deliverables

- Web app built with **React/Next.js + TypeScript**
- Integrated backend (Next.js API routes)
- Deployed MVP (Vercel or Cloudflare)
- Short README explaining structure & trade-offs
